The cgi-bin/perlmodules folder is mostly empty by default, but it exists so if
your server is missing any of the Perl modules that UserBase needs (or that
it can optionally use), then you have a ready-made place to put them:
UserBase will automatically search this folder when attempting to load its
Perl modules.
