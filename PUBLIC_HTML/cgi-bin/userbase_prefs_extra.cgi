# To configure UserBase, you can edit the userbase_prefs.cgi file and adjust
# the prefs right there.  Or, you can copy just those prefs that you actually
# want to change, and paste them into this _extra prefs file to adjust them.
# The app will behave the same either way, but the benefit of the _extra file
# is that it makes future app upgrades easier, because new versions of the app
# will include a new userbase_prefs.cgi file that you'll need to install,
# replacing your old one.  So if all your prefs adjustments are in a separate
# _extra prefs file, then you can install the new main prefs file, overwriting
# the old one, yet your customizations will be preserved.
